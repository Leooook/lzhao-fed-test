## Description of my solution

Talk us through your solution, thought process etc here.

I completed the work through the following steps:
1. check/modify the environment and config (package.json/webpack.config/jest.config)
2. Build structure of App and create component files:
   header -- header of website
   loader -- loading component, use for when loading data
   feature -- container of all cards
   detail -- each card's detail
3. I try to use TDD and the test content first 

## Things I would do next

Anything that you didn't get time to do should go here.

## Assumptions that I made

Any assumptions that were made about the application - this could be around acceptance criteria etc.
